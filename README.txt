WHEAT 0.1-alpha
----------

This branch contains the source code for WHEAT, an extension of BFT-SMART that implements the optimizations and vote assignment schemes described in [1]. It can be deployed/executed in the same manner as the standard library.

Bear in mind that this code is highly experimental and not properly tested, 

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions!
